# Project Progress: User Registration & Login API Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-05

### Completed Tasks

#### Dependency Management
- Added GraphQL Java Kickstart dependencies (`com.graphql-java-kickstart:graphql-spring-boot-starter:15.1.0` and `com.graphql-java-kickstart:graphql-java-tools:14.0.0`) to `build.gradle` to enable GraphQL Kickstart functionality and resolve type resolution errors for `graphql.kickstart` packages.

#### DTOs
- Created `AuthPayload.java` in `src/main/java/com/CarSelling/Sell/the/old/Car/dto/` to represent the GraphQL authentication response, resolving an import error.
